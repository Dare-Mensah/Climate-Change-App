Not only will this help create a natural fertiliser and keep your garden green, it’ll also reduce the amount of waste going to landfill – and as it won’t break down anaerobically, there will not be a build-up of methane gas. If you can’t compost at home, you could find out if there are any local compost schemes available, or if your local authority collects food waste alongside other recycling. Make sure to only compost organic waste to avoid unwanted pests.'
